BiOmino
=======

A preliminary draw of   Ardomino schema in order to build a  talking sensor framework for biometeorological measures ( BiOmino).
The aim of the procedure is to lead an effective demostration of Data2Conversation paradigm.
Informative insights done by multiple data sensors flow are physically  parametrized  in several menaingful classes.
PyMeteoSalute library have provided to classify data in 7 classes of outdoor thermal comfort that generally 
represent the staate peceveid by peolple.
On these different classes of textual messages could be  created 
and are potentially sharable in a social media channel ( Twitter).

The code is primitive.
